# Feed Reader Testing

The goal of this Udacity project is to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application (Feed Reader). These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Why this Project?

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


# Tests

1. Feeds:
  - a test to ensure that each feed has an URL defined and not empty
  - a test to ensure that each feed has a Name defined and not empty
2. The menu:
